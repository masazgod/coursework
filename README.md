Hopfield Neural Network Demo (raylib)

This is a C application built with raylib that demonstrates how a Hopfield neural network works.
The user can draw a binary pattern on a grid, add some noise to it, and then let the network try to restore the original pattern.

The interface includes a grid for drawing and several control buttons such as CLEAR, FILL, SHUFFLE CORRECTION, ANIMATE, and RECOGNIZE, similar to the demo shown in the screenshot.
